<h1 class="title toc-ignore">OWGR: Longevity</h1>

</div>


<div id="longevity-in-golf" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Longevity in Golf</strong></h1>
<p>In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes
and the smoothness of Adam Scott’s golf swing.</p>
<p>After a run of poor form to start the year of 2024, he has had a
resurgence since the month of July, including a great run in the FedEx
Cup playoffs. He finished tied-2nd at the BMW Championship and tied-4th
at the Tour Championship. This lead me to think: Adam Scott has been
“good” for an awful long time, but how long has that been?</p>
<p>I dove into data from (the sometimes controversial) Official World
Golf Rankings (OWGR) to consider how Scott’s career trajectory compares
to many of his peers……and naturally because I’m an Irish golf fan I
found a way to end up talking about Rory McIlroy as well along the
way….</p>
<p>From an initial study of the data, I settled on two measures of
career consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consecutive weeks<sup>*</sup> in OWGR in top 50</li>
<li>Consecutive weeks<sup>*</sup> in OWGR in top 100</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>*</sup>The 13 week period with no ranking update during COVID-19
lockdowns in 2020 was treated as a single week for this analysis</p>
<p>As you will see further below, I think the emergence of LIV golf
complicates matters slightly. It will also make this kind of analysis
much harder to do in the future, without the ability to put the
performances of LIV golfers in context.</p>
<div id="data-overview" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Data Overview</strong></h3>
<p>I downloaded individual ranking histories for a selection of golfers
with careers of prolonged prominence during the OWGR era (mid 1980s -
Present). They were downloaded from the <a
href="https://www.owgr.com/">OWGR website</a> up until the week
ending/starting 6th October 2024. A selection of 8 golfers were chosen
that are outlined in the table below. Greg Norman is the only one
without an active world ranking, although Fred Couples, Ernie Els and
Vijay Singh are also not particularly active.</p>
<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-05fee8053abef7069e85" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-05fee8053abef7069e85">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"],["Adam Scott","Ernie Els","Fred Couples","Greg Norman","Phil Mickelson","Sergio Garcia","Tiger Woods","Vijay Singh"],["2000-01-09","1989-02-05","1988-12-25","1986-09-14","1990-01-14","1996-01-07","1994-02-06","1988-12-25"],["2024-10-06","2024-10-06","2024-10-06","2014-12-28","2024-10-06","2024-10-06","2024-10-06","2024-10-06"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Name<\/th>\n      <th>Date of first ranking<\/th>\n      <th>Date of last ranking (as of this article)<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"lengthChange":false,"searching":false,"bPaginate":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"Name","targets":1},{"name":"Date of first ranking","targets":2},{"name":"Date of last ranking (as of this article)","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>As an Irishman, I felt compelled to also examine the rankings of some
Irish golfers. For a small nation, Ireland has contributed a lot to the
golfing world. This has included a collection of major champions, Ryder
Cup heroes and media personalities. The selection of players listed in
the table below is fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-beb2b49969abe337f9fb" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

<p>With the dataset established, the next thing to do is to examine the
trajectories of the careers of these 15 players.</p>
</div>
<div id="ranking-timelines" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Ranking Timelines</strong></h3>
<div id="promiment-stars" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Promiment Stars</strong></h4>
<p>Upon viewing Adam Scott’s career trajectory on a graph with log
y-scale, we can see the remarkable longevity of his career. He broke
into the world top 100 in July 2001 and he remained there in the 23
years since. He then worked to establish himself in the top 50 through
the 2002 season and has only fallen out of the top 50 four times during
this period. Two of those were fairly sharp declines that occurred in
2009 and 2018, reaching low points of 76 and 82 respectively. Another
was falling to a ranking of 51 for just one week in January 2022 and
then lastly a more gradual decline throughout the 2023 and first half of
2024, reaching a ranking of 64, before his most recent upturn in
results. While he has occasionally dropped out of the world top 50, it
did make me wonder how this period of more than 23 years in the world
top 100 compared to his peers.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a collection of global superstars of the
1980s/1990s/2000s were chosen and I looked at their longest spells of
consecutive weeks in both the world top 50 and top 100. Looking at this
we can see that the weeks spent in the top 100 by Adam Scott has been
bested by two golfers, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els. What is utterly
baffling is that 1353 of Phil’s 1425 weeks in the top 100 was also spent
in the top 50, entering the top 50 on 28th November 1993 and remaining
there until 3rd of November 2019, spending more time in the top 50 than
anyone else has spent in the top 100. He then fell out of top 100 on the
7th March 2021 bring to an end a run of weeks spent in the top 100. He
then had a brief resurgence in his ranking on the back of his win at the
2021 PGA championship before starting a marked decline as the various
machinations of the emergence of LIV golf took shape. Like him or loath
him, you have to admire the golfing career of Lefty.</p>
<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-ff6ebca48722ac020fb2" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-ff6ebca48722ac020fb2">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"],["Phil Mickelson","Ernie Els","Sergio Garcia","Adam Scott","Vijay Singh","Tiger Woods","Greg Norman","Fred Couples"],[1425,1215,1209,1201,1105,964,782,674],[1353,965,574,410,925,780,670,637]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Name<\/th>\n      <th>Max Consecutive Weeks in Top 100<\/th>\n      <th>Max Consecutive Weeks in Top 50<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"lengthChange":false,"searching":false,"bPaginate":false,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"Name","targets":1},{"name":"Max Consecutive Weeks in Top 100","targets":2},{"name":"Max Consecutive Weeks in Top 50","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Similarly to Mickelson, the Big Easy rose to prominence in the early
90’s, achieving the various OWGR landmarks about a year before Phil.
Els’s ranking also dipped prior to his last major success, the 2012 Open
Championship, followed by a gradual decline in recent years. Again
another remarkable golfing career, with a beautifully smooth swing
(possibly even smoother than Adam Scott’s).</p>
<p>One can’t write an article about golf rankings without mentioning
Tiger Woods. His era of extreme dominance in the late 90s and early
2000s just wasn’t quite long lived enough, with him dropping briefly out
of the top 50 in late 2011 and then the major injuries that lead to his
back surgery causing him to fall outside the world top 100 in March
2015, a few months before his longtime rival Els. Thankfully he was able
to make his memorable comeback, culminating in his victory at the 2019
Masters.</p>
<p>One final player to mention from this cohort is Sergio Garcia. In a
similar way to Scott, he also experienced some dips in performance that
led to him falling outside the top 50, just once in the case of Garcia
during 2010 and 2011. He shot to prominence in 1999 as a swashbuckling
19 year old, finishing in second place in the PGA Championship behind
Tiger Woods with his famous shot from the tree roots at Medinah. There
were some bumps along the road as he struggled with his putter and his
temperament at times through the years, but his impeccable ball striking
meant that he was always a mainstay in the upper echelons of the golfing
world throughout all of the 2000s and 2010s. And he was ultimately
rewarded with his sole major victory at the 2017 Masters after many near
misses along the way. Similar to Mickelson, Garcia’s decision to make
the move to LIV golf in 2022 lead to a precipitous fall in his ranking.
Around the time of his famous outburst at the Well’s Fargo in May 2022
Garcia’s ranking had been hovering in around the 40s for much of the
previous couple of years, but by November of that year he fallen outside
the world top 100. That brought an end to an uninterrupted run of M
weeks in the world top 100, dating back to July 1999. His recent T12
finish at the US Open this year, did serve to remind us of his
tremendous talent and leave us wondering a major “what if?” about what
trajectory his ranking would have followed if this seismic schism in the
game of golf had not occurred. Also, sorry for forgetting to say Happy
Birthday in January Sergio.</p>

<h4><strong>Irish Players</strong></h4>
<p>This Irish cohort has brought some fantastic golfing memories to the
author (a mid-teen handicapper, who dreamed of being able to emulate
them), with fantastic golfing achievements by all of them. Five
different major champions, a Ryder Cup winner and Peter Lawrie.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy rose into the world top 100 on the 19th of October 2008.
Five weeks later he was inside the top 50 and there he has remained
since then. In August 2009 his ranking plummeted to 29. After averting
this crisis, he has spent the last 15 years inside the world top 20.</p>
<p>Shane Lowry has taken over from Padraig Harrington in recent years as
the next highest ranked Irish golfer.</p>

<div id="key-dates-on-the-horizon" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Key Dates on the Horizon</strong></h3>
<p>In terms of the tables listed above, there are some potential notable
dates in the future.</p>
<p>For <strong>Adam Scott</strong> and his top 100 streak, he will
definitely surpass Sergio Garcia next week (1st December 2024).
Similarly he will absolutely certainly pass Ernie Els in the following
month on 12th January 2025. The difficulty will be in breaking the
record of Mickelson, where he will need to maintain his level of play
within the world top 100 until 21st January 2029.</p>
<p>Meanwhile for <strong>McIlroy</strong> and his top 50 streak, the
next few players ahead of him will require some time to overcome. The
first one being Vijay Singh’s spell of 925 weeks in just over 2 years
time, which could possibly occur on 1st November 2026. After that Els
could be surpassed on 8th August 2027. Just like for Scott, to achieve
the monumental feat of beating the accomplishments Phil is particularly
difficule. It would require Rory to remain in the world top 50 for
another decade! If he was able to achieve this, then on the 14th January
2035 would become the players with the longest number of consecutive
weeks spent inside of the world top 50.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is worth saying that neither of these golfers have had
careers that have come anywhere close to the level of dominance of Tiger
Woods. It’s just that Tiger’s career aligns with the old adage “The
flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long”. He was utterly
dominant, but his injuries and personal issues meant that he was unable
to sustain that over 20+ years. This tweet by Lou Stagner put that into

<p>As a classic tormented Irish golf fan, I set out to write an article
about Adam Scott and ended up talking just as much about Rory McIlroy as
well. Both golfers have had remarkable careers, with golf swings that
combine elegance and power in slightly different ways. To better the
consistency and longevity of Phil Mickelson will be a challenge for them
in the years ahead, but I’ll continue to be a fan of the two of them and
wish them the best.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.owgr.com/">OWGR website</a> was crucial in
extracting the data for this analysis. But I did find the interface
clunky and cumbersome to work with, and there appears to be something
weird going on in their data for late in the careers of Lawrie, McGinley
and Clarke (see graph above).</p>

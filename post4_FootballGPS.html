<h1 class="title toc-ignore">5-a-side Football: GPS Analysis</h1>

</div>


<div id="a-side-football-gps-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>5-a-side Football: GPS Analysis</strong></h1>
<p>I am a mediocre athlete and not a particularly gifted football
player. What I lack in skill, I try to compensate with defensive work
(as you will come to learn as you read) and effort. While I am far from
an elite athlete, I am a self-confessed nerd who loves data. In early
2019 I bought a Garmin GPS watch and out of my own curiosity started
using it to record running activities during my weekly 5-a-side games.
This is an analysis of 5 years of GPS watch data from 144 games of
5-a-side football played on the same pitch.</p>
<p>These 5 years have produced some interesting results, highlighted the
accuracy limitations of these sensors and captured a change in my style
of play. As well as GPS data, the watch also collected heart rate and
instantaneous speed/pace data which were analysed as well. This gives an
overview of the main things I found while analysing the data.</p>
<div id="data-overview" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Data Overview</strong></h3>
<div id="watch" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Watch</strong></h4>
<p>The watch is a Garmin Vivoactive3, shown below. This is a smartwatch
with built-in GPS and it records the distance, pace and location for
outdoor activities, like running and cycling. It records a measurement
of these quantities about every 2 seconds (by default, more on this
later), with over 175,000 samples in total across the entire collection
of 144 games.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">

class="uri">https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/571520</a>)</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>Data was accessed from the GarminConnect environment using this very
useful <a
href="https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect">python
library</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pitch-dimensions-orientation-and-accuracy"
class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Pitch Dimensions, Orientation and Accuracy</strong></h4>
<p>The pitch is a 5-a-side cage, with rough dimensions of 27m (length) x
18m (width). The games are informal, “pick-up style” games, where one
member of the group divides the group of 10 into two teams of 5 which
are (hopefully) fairly balanced in terms of ability.</p>
<p>To analyse the GPS data I needed to establish the coordinates of the
pitch as a reference. I took the coordinates of the four corners of the
pitch in latitude and longitude. These were then converted into the
Irish Tranverse Mercator (ITM) coordinate system, which has units in
metres, allowing for easier arithmetic with location data. For further
analysis of the data, the pitch was then subdivided into a grid of 54
squares of roughly 3m x 3m in size, which is shown below. The centre of
the pitch is shown by a red dot, which will be used later.</p>
<center>
<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimsir-spoirt/aimsir-spoirt.github.io/main/post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/Pitch_Outline_UCD_cage.png"
style="width:75.0%" />
</center>
<p>One thing that I realised was the importance of noting the direction
of play in the title of the activity, as I could be playing either
direction depending on the week. If I forgot to note down the direction,
I had to go back to the output in the Garmin Connect webpage and try and
work out the most likely direction of play. As it turned out, I most
frequently played in the “right-to-left” direction, about twice as often
as “left-to-right”, so I chose that as the primary direction to be used.
Instead of considering the two directions in isolation, I decided to
dust off my knowledge of Euclidean transformations and write some code
to reflect data points through the centre point of the pitch (red dot in
figure above). This turned every “left-to-right” game into a
“right-to-left” game so that all games could be analysed together,
making a total dataset of over 175,000 data points. An example of
reflecting 11 data points is shown in figure below.</p>
<center>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimsir-spoirt/aimsir-spoirt.github.io/main/post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/test_reflection_pitch.png"
style="width:75.0%" /></p>
</center>
<p>As I quickly learned, GPS measurements from the watch were far from
precise. This is a well known phenomenon in academic literature (<a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220729">1</a>,
<a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/17543371221098888">2</a>,
<a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01399-1">3</a>).
The GPS data for a single match on the 16th August 2023 are shown in the
figure below. As you can see, many values lie outside the boundary of
the pitch. By considering a large enough sample of data, the hope is
that the signal will emerge from the noisy nature of each individual
match and some useful results can be gotten from the data.</p>

<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<div id="total-distance" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Total Distance</strong></h4>
<p>The average total distance (coverted into km per 60mins to account
for varying game length) is shown below as boxplots, split by year. The
average distance covered has not varied significantly over the 5 years,
generally in the region of 3.0-3.5 km per 60 mins. I have tried to
consciously cover more ground during the games, but this appears to be
the ballpark figure that I land on based on my athletic profile and the
pitch dimensions.</p>
<p><img src="post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/dist_box-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="field-positions" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Field Positions</strong></h4>
<p>The frequency with which I occupied a given zone on the pitch is
shown in the plot below. My defensive nature is evident in the plot with
my tendency to occupy central defensive zones, trying to make best of
use of the skills that I have that can positively impact on my team’s
chance of winning. Unsurprisingly, I am seldom found in the attacking
half of the pitch. Although due to the small nature of the playing area,
I do have non-zero frequencies for all zones on the pitch.</p>
<center>
<p><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimsir-spoirt/aimsir-spoirt.github.io/main/post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/zone_heatmap.png"
style="width:75.0%" /></p>
</center>
</div>
<div id="heart-rate" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Heart Rate</strong></h4>
<p>The distribution of heart rate data for the entire dataset is shown
in the graph below. As well as being an enjoyable pastime, I also try to
use these football games as a Zone 4/5 cardio session. There are a
variety of ways to potentially define different heart rate zones. Garmin
estimates the lower bound of Z4 to be 154bpm. Meanwhile
omnicalculator.com has a variety of methods to estimate heart rate
zones. These uses max heart rate and resting heart rate as inputs to the
formula. Max heart rate can either be taken from the data (giving a Z4
HR of 157bpm), or estimated using a formula such as “Oakland nonlinear
formula” (giving a Z4 HR of 160bpm). I have taken the highest of these
values (160bpm) and plotted that as the dashed vertical line in the
histogram in the histogram plot.</p>
<p><img src="post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/hr_hist-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I have tried to optimise time spent in those high heart rate zones,
as this is generally viewed as being beneficial for cardiovascular
health. But there is a clear visual anomaly that can’t be overlooked in
the data. The data has a slightly strange bimodal distribution (two
peaks in the histogram plot). A further peculiarity in the data was also
found when boxplots were created for each month, shown below. Both the
means(green trianglees)/medians(horizontal lines) and the inter-quartile
ranges tend to be higher during the middle of the year (May-September)
compared to the rest of the year.</p>
<p><img src="post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/hr_box-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To study this a little bit further. I plotted histograms where the
data was split by both year and whether the month lies inside or outside
the May-September month window, shown below. Data in the summertime
period (orange) tends to have a much higher frequency of high heart rate
values compared to the remainder of the year. Data for summer in 2019 is
the one outlier, but I think this may be attributed to not wearing the
watch tightly enough during the game in the first year of using the
watch.</p>
<p><img src="post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/hr_ys_hist-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The bimodal distribution is generally most apparent during the
non-summer months (green, left column in panel of histograms). I do not
have any expertise in wrist-based heart rate sensors, but I have seen
some experts in the area talk about the limitations of this methodology.
One (very speculative) theory is that I have poor circulation to my
hands (easily get numb hands during cold weather) and maybe this leads
to less accurate measurements of my heart rate. One way to investigate
this further, might be to get a chest-strap heart rate monitor and see
if that improved the quality of the heart rate data.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, I do generally meet the objective of getting my
heart rate elevated during the games, and it does appear to be doing a
little bit better at accumulating time above my Z4 heart-rate threshold.
Although my own confidence in the validity of these numbers is very
low.</p>
</div>
<div id="running-speed" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Running Speed</strong></h4>
<p>Another quantity measured by the watch is pace/speed. The histogram
of speed (in m/s) is shown in the figure below. The speeds observed are
far from being anything impressive, but I’ll use the excuse that the
small pitch dimensions make high speed sprints less likely.</p>
<p><img src="post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/speed_hist-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Also the most frequent observed speed turned out to 0 m/s. Before
labeling myself as a lazy good-for-nothing that just stands around doing
nothing, I looked at where on the pitch I tended to be stationary, shown
in figure below. The vast majority of these cases occur in the 4 zones
that are closest to my own goal-line, which probably represent my turns
playinh in goal during the games. Apart from these, there are also some
cases of being stationary in central areas around halfway as well.</p>
<center>
<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimsir-spoirt/aimsir-spoirt.github.io/main/post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/zone_zero_speed.png"
style="width:75.0%" />
</center>
</div>
<div id="attempted-change-of-approach" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Attempted Change of Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Those observations of zero speed in central areas, in the previous
figure above, probably happen when my team has possession of the ball
and I am sitting back in defence. This conservative style of play is not
suited to playing on such a small pitch, where playing a position
doesn’t really make sense. In the last couple of years I have tried to
offer myself as more of an attacking outlet. To check if there was any
evidence of this change in mindset. To do this, I calculated positional
heatmaps (as in [Field Positions] section) for two different 2-year
periods: 2019-2020 and 2022-2023. The difference between these two maps
were then used to calculated percentage changes in my average position,
shown below.</p>
<center>
<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aimsir-spoirt/aimsir-spoirt.github.io/main/post4_FootballGPS_files/figure-html/zone_perc_diff.png"
style="width:75.0%" />
</center>
<p>This change in approach is borne out in the data, where the red areas
across almost all zones in the attacking half of the pitch show that I
am spending more time there in recent years. The only place in the
defensive half of the pitch that is red is actually close to the goal,
which suggests that I have been spending more time on average in goal
during the last two years compared to 2019-2020. Maybe I need to have a
word with my colleagues about this…..</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>
<p>Trying to use a GPS watch to record activities on such a small
football pitch is riddled with inaccuracies. I hoped that by collecting
a large enough dataset from multiple years some useful information can
be found within the noisy data. All in all I think I did find some
interesting results, but at the same time, all results shown here should
really be taken with a substantial pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The [Heart Rate] data are particularly dubious with a clear seasonal
pattern to the observations, highlighting the limitations of using
optical wrist-based HR measurements during intense activity (and
variables environmental conditions). These may be exacerbated by my own
physiological profile. It might be the case that getting myself a
chest-strap HR monitor would be useful if I want to get more reliable
heart-rate data from my 5-a-side games, but for the moment that is a low
priority.</p>
<p>In terms of GPS tracks, it was reassuring to see that my desire to
adopt a more attacking style of play in the last two years could be seen
in the data (see [Attempted change of approach]). Meanwhile for GPS
accuracy, many studies have highlighted the limitations of GPS devices
for activities with lots of change of direction (<a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220729">1</a>,
<a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/17543371221098888">2</a>,
<a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01399-1">3</a>).
That being said, my curiosity is still alive and well and I will
continue to track the activities, as I enjoy doing and understand the
limitations of the data. I will soon start recording my games with a
Garmin Forerunner 255 watch. For this device, Garmin’s marketing and
youtube reviewers (like <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJsPo2qMfX0">DesFit</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYJfVczBORQ">DC Rainmaker</a>)
have suggested that the multi-band GPS system on newer watches has the
potential to produce more accurate GPS tracks. In the making of this
article I have also learned more about my old watch that I should’ve
been aware of before. It turns out that the sampling rate for activities
can be changed on the watch. Garmin offer two possible options: “smart”
and “every second”, and my watch has been set to “smart” as default.
Therefore I could have tracked these activities with about twice the
temporal resolution and is something I will look into with my new watch
as well. These activities are in the region of 1 hour in duration, so
the added demand on battery life from the higher sampling rate would
never be an issue. It will be interesting to see if these changes will
offer any better insight in the years ahead.</p>
